        <h2>About Vikram Batra </h2>
    
        <p> <h3>Captain Vikram Batra (1974-1999) was an officer in the Indian Army who became a national hero for his bravery during the Kargil War between India and Pakistan in 1999. Known for his fearless leadership and indomitable spirit, Batra was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest military honor, for his extraordinary valor in combat.</h3></p>
           <h2>Early Life and Career</h2>
       <p>  <h3>  Born on September 9, 1974, in Palampur, Himachal Pradesh, Vikram Batra was a bright and spirited child. He completed his early education in his hometown and later pursued a degree in Bachelor of Science (Medical) from DAV College in Chandigarh. During his college years, he joined the National Cadet Corps (NCC), which fueled his interest in the Indian Army. After completing his education, he was selected for the Indian Military Academy (IMA) in Dehradun and was commissioned into the 13th Battalion, Jammu and Kashmir Rifles, in 1997.</h3></p>
         <h2>Role in the Kargil War</h2>
         <p> <h3>During the Kargil War, Batra was assigned the task of recapturing key peaks in the Drass and Kargil sectors. His most notable operation was the capture of Point 5140, a strategically significant peak held by the enemy. Batra led his men through treacherous terrain, overcoming harsh weather conditions and relentless enemy fire. His famous war cry, “Yeh Dil Maange More!” (This heart wants more!), became synonymous with the Indian victory at Kargil and a testament to his courage.

            Following the successful capture of Point 5140, Batra volunteered for a more dangerous mission: the capture of Point 4875. Despite the adverse conditions and steep slopes, he and his team fought valiantly, neutralizing enemy positions one by one. During the operation, Batra was gravely wounded while rescuing a fellow soldier but continued to fight until his last breath. </h3></p>
