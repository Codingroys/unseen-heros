        <h2>Early Life </h2>
    
        <p> <h3>Sanjay Kumar was born in 1976 in the village of Kalol Bakain in Bilaspur District, Himachal Pradesh. Before joining the Indian Army, he worked as a taxi driver in Delhi. His desire to serve the nation led him to enlist in the army, where he joined the 13th Battalion of the Jammu & Kashmir Rifles (13 JAK Rif).

         <h2>Heroism during the Kargil War:</h2>
         <p><h3>During the Kargil War in 1999, Rifleman Sanjay Kumar was part of an assault team tasked with recapturing Point 4875, a strategic peak in the Mushkoh Valley, heavily fortified by Pakistani forces. Despite facing fierce enemy fire, Sanjay Kumar showed immense courage.

            His gallant actions that led to the award of the Param Vir Chakra are summarized as follows:
            
            On July 4, 1999, while advancing towards the peak, his team was pinned down by machine-gun fire from well-entrenched enemy positions.
            With no regard for his safety, Rifleman Sanjay Kumar charged uphill towards the enemy bunker and engaged in hand-to-hand combat, killing three enemy soldiers.
            Despite being critically injured, he captured the enemy's machine gun and continued to fight, helping his platoon advance and secure the position.
            His fearless assault and leadership were key to the Indian forces' success in capturing the strategically important Point 4875, later named "Batra Top" in honor of his fellow PVC awardee, Captain Vikram Batra.</h3></p>
            <h2>Post Kargil War:</h2>
            <p><h3>Sanjay Kumar continues to serve in the Indian Army, rising through the ranks. He is highly respected for his bravery and is often referred to as one of India's bravest soldiers. His story remains an inspiration to many for selflessness and patriotism.

                Subedar Major Sanjay Kumar's actions reflect the highest traditions of valor and duty in the Indian Army, making him a living legend.</h3></p>
              <h2>Family</h2>  
              <p><h3>Father: Sanjay Kumarâ€™s father, Durga Ram, was a former soldier who served in the Indian Army, which likely inspired his desire to join the armed forces.
                Mother: His mother, Bhag Devi, was a homemaker.
                Spouse and Children: Sanjay Kumar is married and has children, though details about his wife and children are not widely publicized to respect their privacy.
                Sanjay Kumar's roots in a small village, combined with the values he inherited from his family, helped shape him into the brave soldier he became. Despite the national fame following his award of the Param Vir Chakra, he remains connected to his family and maintains a humble life.</h3></p>
